    "Signs and Symptoms":"dysmenorrhoea and abdominal pain; on examination, a 16\/40-week size abdominal-pelvic mass was palpated; rapid abdominal expansion over a period of a few weeks associated with back pain; a 18\u201320\/40-week size mass was noted arising from the pelvis",
    "Comorbidities":null,
    "Diagnosis":"uterine malignant mesenchymoma (leiomyosarcoma with chondrosarcomatous and osteosarcomatous differentiation) with pulmonary metastases",
    "Laboratory Values":null,
    "Pathology":"the histology confirmed four leiomyomata showing some hyalinization, the largest 65 mm in greatest dimension; the uterus had a lobulated external surface. the endometrium was haemorrhagic and a polyoid tan-coloured mass was seen within the cavity. there was a large circumscribed fleshy myometrial mass 145 mm in maximum dimension. sectioning showed areas of necrosis and a gritty sensation was noted. this was sampled extensively. separate fragments with a uniform cut surface were also received. as the uterus did not have a recognizable ovary attached to it, these separate fragments were presumed to be ovaries.haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of sections taken from the largest mass revealed a pleomorphic tumour composed of spindle cells, which in most areas showed smooth muscle differentiation (figure 1) including interspersed benign-looking fibres. there were abrupt transitions between pleomorphic areas and benign smooth muscle areas. the spindle cells included multinucleate forms and varied in size, shape, nuclear outline and chromatin pattern (figure 2). extensive malignant chondroid and osteoid differentiation was present with calcification of the latter (figure 3). focally, rhabdoid-like cells were seen. there was a high mitotic index with numerous atypical figures. the edge of the mass was generally well circumscribed but many infiltrative areas were also noted. the tumour cells surrounded numerous blood vessels at the periphery and vascular invasion was seen; the separate pieces and the presumed left and right ovaries were in fact nodules with a similar appearance to the main mass. the serosal surface, likewise, had a similar appearance to these and represented involvement by tumour. the residual myometrium contained several small intramural and subserosal leiomyomas. away from the tumour there was evidence of a foreign body reaction, which may have represented the site of previous myomectomy;the endometrium showed late menstrual and early proliferative phase activity. the described polyp was largely necrotic endometrial tissue and was presumably retained menstrual material. the cervical stump showed the mass extending down into the muscle of the cervix. the cervical resection margin was 8 mm from the nearest tumour cells. the cervical tissue was otherwise unremarkable. the left fallopian tube was normal. neither ovary was identified",
    "Pharmacological Therapy":"palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin 75 mg\/m2",
    "Interventional Therapy":"embolization; myomectomy; hysterectomy",
    "Patient Outcome Assessment":"the patient died of disease at the age of 44 years after one cycle of chemotherapy, 34 months after the onset of initial symptoms",
    "Age":41.0
