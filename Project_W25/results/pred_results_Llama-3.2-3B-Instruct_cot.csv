CCR2655,good prognosis with complete remission,"The patient has primary CNS ALCL, a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma. The patient has undergone craniospinal radiotherapy and has received high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and intrathecal chemotherapy. The patient's pathology report shows immunopositivity for CD30, ALK, vimentin, LCA, TIA-1, and Granzyme B, but negative immunoreactivity for AE1/AE3, CD20, CD3, CD68 (KP1), CD68 (PGM1), CD4, and CD8. This suggests that the patient's lymphoma is ALK-positive, which is a good prognostic factor. The patient's response to chemotherapy has been good, with no clear neoplastic lymphoid cells in the CSF and no evidence of neoplasm recurrence. The patient's muscle strength has also recovered to 4/5. Overall, the patient's outlook is good, with a high likelihood of long-term survival. The patient's age and overall health status also contribute to a favorable prognosis.  The patient's outlook is expected to be good, with a high likelihood of long-term survival.

CCR1393,"the patient died of disease at the age of 44 years after one cycle of chemotherapy, 34 months after the onset of initial symptoms","The patient has a rare and aggressive type of uterine cancer, leiomyosarcoma with chondrosarcomatous and osteosarcomatous differentiation. The cancer has already metastasized to the lungs. The patient's age is 41, which is relatively young for this type of cancer. The cancer is highly aggressive, with a high mitotic index and numerous atypical figures. The tumor cells have invaded blood vessels and there is evidence of vascular invasion. The cancer is also highly differentiated, with extensive malignant chondroid and osteoid differentiation. Given these factors, the patient's outlook in response to chemotherapy is poor. The cancer is likely to be resistant to chemotherapy, and the patient's age and overall health may not be sufficient to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy. The patient's best chance of survival is likely to be with palliative care, which may include chemotherapy, but the goal of treatment will be to manage symptoms and improve quality of life rather than to achieve a cure.<|eot_id|>"
