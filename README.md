**Class projects for BIOINFO 201: Seminar: Advanced Methods in Computational Biology taken Fall 2024 and Winer 2025**

**Fall 2024:**  This project focuses on using GSEApy, a suite of tools implemented in Python/Rust to conduct gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which implements a wrapper for Enrichr, a website conducting overrepresentation analysis for many well-known gene set libraries such as the Gene Ontology (GO), Kegg, Reactome, and HDSigDB. The tutorial code provides an example set of differentially expressed genes and how to use GSEApy and the Enrichr module to match those genes to biologically relevant pathways.

**Winter 2025:** This project focuses on utilizing publically available models on Hugging Face, and in particular, assessed Llama 3.2, Gemini 3, and Phi 4 Mini capabilities in chemotherapy patient outcome prediction using EHR data of 185 chemotherapy clinical cases, achieving a 0.5 cosine similarity.
